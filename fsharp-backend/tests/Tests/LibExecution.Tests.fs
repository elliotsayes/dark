// Read all test files. Test file format is as follows:
//
// Lines with just comments or whitespace are ignored
// Tests are made up of code and comments, comments are used as names
//
// Test indicators:
//   [tests.name] denotes that the following lines (until the next test
//   indicator) are single line tests, that are all part of the test group
//   named "name". Single line tests should evaluate to true, and may have a
//   comment at the end, which will be the test name
//
//   [test.name] indicates that the following lines, up until the next test
//   indicator, are all a single test named "name", and should be parsed as
//   one.
