## Setting up your editor

**Note that this doc is incomplete and sometimes may require tinkering after doing the actions here. We welcome additions, clarifications, and instructions on how to set up other editors.**

### VS Code

VS Code works pretty well when set up to run within the container. Choose "open folder within container" and it should work.

Use Ionide for F#. If you have problems with intellisense, you may need to
start a terminal and run `dotnet tool restore` and the `dotnet build` and
restart the container once or twice using the "developer: reload window"
command.

### Merlin

Merlin is an OCaml language server that provides things like autocompletion,
type information, and go-to-definition functionality. Because all OCaml
libraries are installed inside the container and not on your local machine,
merlin needs to be running inside the container. Unfortunately, this install is
not completely isolated and we still need some supporting things installed on
your host machine.

The way this works is that you'll need merlin on your host machine (to get the editor
support files) and then you'll point those at the `scripts/ocamlmerlin` wrapper
to execute the actual process inside the container. This means that you need
those scripts first in your `$PATH`.

- `export $PATH=[path to dark]/scripts:$PATH` in your shell config
- Install merlin:
  - `brew install opam`
  - `opam init -c 4.06.1`
    - grep `esy.json` for `"ocaml"` to ensure the version matches
    - copy snippet to your bashrc/shell config. DO NOT DO THIS FOR zsh. SEE BELOW.
  - `opam install merlin.3.2.2`
- Install editor integration:
  - vim+plug:
    - make sure you have a python provider for vim. Gvim comes with one. If you're using neovim, you can get one with `pip3 install pynvim`
    - add `Plug '~/.opam/default/share/merlin', { 'for': ['ocaml', 'merlin' ], 'rtp': 'vim' }` to your vim config file
  - others: ??

CAVEAT: If you install the zsh config that merlin recommends, it will
automatically execute the equivalent of `eval $(opam env)` after every command.
This command mucks with your `$PATH`, which means that you will never execute
the `scripts/` wrappers you want. Do not use the shell integration. Instead
call `eval $(opam env)` and then `export $PATH=[path to dark]/scripts:$PATH` (put
this in an alias or something).

### Formatting

You will also want to support formatting in your client. Dark uses Prettier for JS/HTML/CSS, and OCamlformat for OCaml and Bucklescript. The script `script/format` can be used to format or check formatting, and there is a pre-commit hook you can use to run it automatically.

For emacs, see [the
readme](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#emacs-setup). For vim:

- install [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
- Add to your `.vimrc` (with an appropriate path-to-dark replacement):

```
set rtp+=~/[path to dark]/dark/scripts/ocamlformat
let g:ale_javascript_prettier_executable= '~/path to dark]/dark/scripts/prettier'
let g:ale_fixers =
\ {'rust': ['rustfmt'],
\  'ocaml':['ocamlformat'],
\  'javascript': ['prettier'],
\  'js': ['prettier'],
\  'html': ['prettier'],
\  'css': ['prettier'],
\  'scss': ['prettier']}
```

### Pre-commit hook

You probably also want to install a pre-commit hook that the formatters for
you.
`cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
